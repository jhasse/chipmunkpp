///
/// A rigid body holds the physical properties of an object. (mass, position, rotation, velocity,
/// etc.) It does not have a shape until you attach one or more collision shapes to it. If youâ€™ve
/// done physics with particles before, rigid bodies differ in that they are able to rotate. Rigid
/// bodies generally tend to have a 1:1 correlation to sprites in a game. You should structure your
/// game so that you use the position and rotation of the rigid body for drawing your sprite.
